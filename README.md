## Intro:

Covid 2020 has demonstrated that many small businesses do not have an equal opportunity to conduct online sales like big businesses. In Canada, approximately 225,000 businesses closed.

Now, imagine you’re a small grocery store. You’re forced to close shop. You’re wondering how you can sell things online or have a pick-up option. And the first place you’d look is to make your website capable of online transactions. 

In our project we hope to democratize online sales. Our webapp will help small businesses sell specific bundles of items online. There are three things this webapp accomplishes:
First it helps customers buy products instantly. By offering a bundle we can potentially reduce the clickthrough rate for common items 
Secondly, it gives businesses that don’t have a complete online inventory the opportunity to sell online 
Lastly, it increases sales in a pandemic world that requires social distancing

## Further work:

While we were able to accomplish a prototype of our webapp during the timeline of the hackathon, these are things we would implement if we were to grow this project. 
We would connect the webapp directly to a payment portal
We would allow the transaction to ping the business owner on a sale 
We would create a Control Panel/ Settings so the business could easily change the product description/ images/ prices/ 
We would increase usability to different web platforms. For example, businesses would be able to use the app on wordpress, javascript websites and so on. We would aim to find a method to add this webapp as a plugin that could be used by various platforms.

Conclusion:
In summary, we would aim with this webapp to help small businesses increase their sales and adapt to an online world. Thank you for listening to our presentation! We hope to see you around the hackathon.
